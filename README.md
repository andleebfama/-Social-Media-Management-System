# Social Media Management System 

A comprehensive database project developed as part of the **Database Systems** course at **Superior University, Lahore**.  
This project models the backend infrastructure of a social media platform, managing users, roles, friendships, posts, comments, notifications, and media — all designed using SQL and fully normalized for data integrity and efficiency.

## Project Overview

The **Social Media Management System** simulates the core data operations of a social networking platform. It supports essential features like user registration, role-based access control, friend requests, post and comment management, private messaging, and notifications — all built with relational database principles.
